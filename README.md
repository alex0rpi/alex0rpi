# Hi! I'm Alex! üëãüèª

Bon dia! My name is Alex Orpinell and I am an engineer reskilled to Backend developer.

I was born in Barcelona, where I was raised and took my engineering degree. For the last academic year I was enticed to pursue my studies abroad so I took a double engineering degree program between UPC (Barcelona) and ENSAM (Bordeaux). Then I started off my work experience back in Barcelona with an automotive engineering company (MAZEL). A year later I decided to move to France again, this time Toulouse, to do an advanced master‚Äôs degree in aeronautical maintenance at ISAE Supaero. Then I had the chance to work for Airbus at the Saint Eloi pylons factory. At first I was a maintainability engineer as a subcontractor for a French company (Aeroconseil) for three years. Then I joined a Spanish supplier (ARITEX) to co-manage the design and implementation of the A330neo pylon assembly line. Two years later tough, I started missing my hometown and also the permanent travelling was taking its toll on my personal life. Thus, after some hard meditating and having spent over 6 years in France, I decided to quit my job, come back to my hometown, and re-think my career. I then started reskilling myself to software development and today I work as a software developer at NTT DATA (Barcelona). I am always eager to level up my knowledge, build projects and try new ways.

# Journalüì∞‚Äã (sort of..)
* July 2025 I got promoted to Engineer!ü•≥ kinda what I am already but anyway, I'm glad I got to this point. It's been 8 months or so in my current project where I got to use Java, JUNIT, Spring, JPA, SQL and other tools in a microservices environment with JENKINS pipeline deployments; so its kinda cool how many different technologies I've been able to use in this time.
* November 2024 A new banking project starts in my work group and I now find myself learning JAVA‚òï and microservices!! Seems I need to get competent at the Spring framework for this new project. Incidently, the basic knowledge I gained from C# and Go is being helpful to grasp and interiorize concepts. Learning a new language (appart from learning a new superpower also makes you re-visit the fundamentals).
* July 2024 Lately I've been thinking about learning in my spare time NextJS (I've always used REACT but I think at some point I need to make the step) and perhaps a new language such as Go, C# or Kotlin for backend dev purposes. I find it worthy and future proved.
* June 2024 üïìüìÖ It's been 6 months already at NTT DATA and here's a summary of my journey and learnings:
  * Utilizing Hyperfront, a JS full-stack framework by Basikon, for a banking loan and dealer portal, integrating React, Bootstrap, MongoDB (pipelines, aggregates, projections), and custom API endpoints.
  * Implemented Jest for unit testing, ensuring an efficient architecture and single-responsability functions.
  * I definitely leveled up my Git skills in this collaborative project and feel confident managing stashes, merges, rebases, conflicts etc.
  * Engaging directly with a French client, refreshing my French language skills, and utilizing Poker planning techniques.
* April 2024 I'm happy to have published a new project for the FCB Rink Hockey Veterans Association (Associaci√≥ de Veterans d'Hoquei Patins del FC Barcelona). I made a static website with React-Vite and Tailwind. [Veterans Hoquei Patins](https://www.veteranshoqueipatinsfcb.es/) I first wanted to make a fullstack app with a KOA backend and a postgresql DB but its for the moment on a different branch, ready to be deployed if they request to have user authentication and blog functionality.

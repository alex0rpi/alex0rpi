# Hi! I'm Alex! üëãüèª

Bon dia! My name is Alex Orpinell and I am an engineer reskilled to Backend developer.

I was born in Barcelona, where I was raised and took my engineering degree. For the last academic year I was enticed to pursue my studies abroad so I took a double engineering degree program between UPC (Barcelona) and ENSAM (Bordeaux). Then I started off my work experience back in Barcelona with an automotive engineering company (MAZEL). A year later I decided to move to France again, this time Toulouse, to do an advanced master‚Äôs degree in aeronautical maintenance at ISAE Supaero. Then I had the chance to work for Airbus at the Saint Eloi pylons factory. At first I was a maintainability engineer as a subcontractor for a French company (Aeroconseil) for three years. Then I joined a Spanish supplier (ARITEX) to co-manage the design and implementation of the A330neo pylon assembly line. Two years later tough, I started missing my hometown and also the permanent travelling was taking its toll on my personal life. Thus, after some hard meditating and having spent over 6 years in France, I decided to quit my job, come back to my hometown, and re-think my career. I then started reskilling myself to software development and today I work as a junior fullstack developer at NTT DATA (Barcelona). I am always eager to level up my knowledge, build projects and try new ways.

# Programing experience
* November 2024 A new project starts within my company and I now find myself learning JAVA‚òï! Seems I need to get competent at the Spring framework for this new project. Incidently, the basic knowledge I gained from C# and Go i being helpful to grasp and interiorize the JAVA syntax. On the other hand it looks like NextJS is gonna have to wait a bit.
* July 2024 Lately I've been thinking about learning in my spare time NextJS (I've always used REACT but I think at some point I need to make the step) and perhaps a new language such as Go, C# or Kotlin for backend dev purposes. I find it worthy and future proved.
* June 2024 üïìüìÖ It's been 6 months already at NTT DATA and here's a summary of my journey and learnings:
  * Utilizing Hyperfront, a JS full-stack framework by Basikon, which integrates backend and frontend seamlessly using React and Bootstrap under the hood and custom API endpoints and many other utilities. Currently, my team applies it to develop a banking loan and dealer portal.
  * This framework is made to work with mongoDB. I've been using some advance query features like pipelines, aggregates and projections.
  * Implemented Jest for unit testing, ensuring a clean and efficient architecture for functions and scripts with clear responsibilities.
  * I definetly leveled up my Git skills in the last months in this collaborative project. I feel confident managing stashes, merges, rebases and conflicts.
  * Engaging directly with a French client, refreshing my French language skills, and utilizing Poker planning techniques.
* April 2024 I'm happy to have published a new project for the FCB Rink Hockey Veterans Association (Associaci√≥ de Veterans d'Hoquei Patins del FC Barcelona). I made a static website with React-Vite and Tailwind. [Veterans Hoquei Patins](https://client-veterans-hoquei.onrender.com/) I first wanted to make a fullstack app with a KOA backend and a postgresql DB but its for the moment on a different branch, ready to be deployed if they request to have user authentication and blog functionality.
* From December 2023 ‚≠êüîãI started a new position as junior engineer at NTT DATA in Barcelona!<br>
* June-December 2023 | Involved in [ITA-WIKI](https://github.com/IT-Academy-BCN/ita-wiki) as backend developer.<br>
# Developer training
* Jan-June 2023 | Backend development bootcamp at Mediatic (Barcelona). The end of bootcamp project is a fullstrack chat web app that can be found in my pinned repositories.<br>
* 2020 - 2022 | Self-taught web development learning (online bootcamps, tutorials etc.)<br>

# Hi! I'm Alex! üëãüèª

Bon dia! My full name is Alex Orpinell and I am an engineer reskilled to software developer.

I was born in Barcelona, where I was raised and took my engineering degree. For the last academic year I was tempted to pursue my studies abroad so I took a double engineering degree program between UPC (Barcelona) and ENSAM (Bordeaux). Then I started off my work experience back in Barcelona for an automotive engineering company (MAZEL). A year later though, I decided to move to France again, this time Toulouse, to do an advanced Master's degree in aeronautical maintenance. Then I had to chance to work for Airbus, first as a subcontractor for a french company (Aeroconseil), and later on for a spanish supplier (ARITEX). After some hard meditating I decided to quit my job and re-think my career direction. Today I live in my hometown Barcelona (Spain) after having spending over 6 years in France.

## Freelance experience üë¶‚Ä¢üèéÔ∏è
2018-2022 | Futures trader. While using the NinjaTrader graphical software I had a grasp of C# for customizing equity indicators, which later led me to further dive into programing. This was the seed that made me discover my interest in frontend and backend web development.
